# PointlessGame
2019

A group project which took place at Instituto Politécnico de Bragança.

### The idea

We received a theme which was "Pointless". From that theme we started thinking about pointless things and it came to our minds <Terrorism> and <Suicide bombers>.
From there we knew what the game was all about, terrorist bombing stuff, but what was the real "pointlessness" of it? So we decided it was meant to destroy things and create even more of those things.
We used the other theme "Overpopulation" to make the "destroyable things", people. And in this was make it about our reality.
Terrorism is pointles because overpopulation makes is so that doesn't matter how many people die, there is always more natality than fatality.

### The Development

Since i was the only one with capabilities in programming, i was given the fate of programming the whole game and animating some parts of it.
We decided to make a game from the style "Angry Birds", because it is about throwing things to explode, but in this case, we throw terrorist's heads.
Along the development, my colleagues would give me sprites which i would replace for the placeholders, so we would see how the game was starting to look like.
I made every person that is hit by the flying head in some speed, lose health or die, depending on the flight force.
Once a person dies, i made a little red particle animation, simulating blood. When a death happens, people of the same kind are spawned near that same area, emphasising the pointlessness of the game.

### Tech && Methodologies
